============
Installation
============

Before you building `libpninexus` from sources one should first check if
pre-built binary packages are available. Building the library from the sources
requires a certain level of expertise which not all users posess.
As
`libpninexus` is mostly a template library only a few non performance critical
components have to be compiled. Therefore, custom builds of the libraries
binaries are not necessary in order to get optimum performance.

.. ============================================================================

Installing pre-built binary packages
====================================

Binary packages are currently available for the following platforms

* Debian/GNU Linux
* Ubuntu Linux

Debian and Ubuntu users
-----------------------

As Debian and Ubuntu are closely related the installation is quite similar.
The packages are provided by a special Debian repository. To work on the
package sources you need to login as `root` user. Use :command:`su` or
:command:`sudo su` on Debian and Ubuntu respectively.
The first task is to add the GPG key of the HDRI repository to your local
keyring

.. code-block:: bash

   $ curl -s http://repos.pni-hdri.de/debian_repo.pub.gpg  | gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring gnupg-ring:/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/debian-hdri-repo.gpg --import
   $ chmod 644 /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/debian-hdri-repo.gpg


The return value of this command line should be `OK`.
In a next step you have to add new package sources to your system. For this
purpose go to :file:`/etc/apt/sources.list.d` and download the sources file.
For Debian (Trixie) use

.. code-block:: bash

   $ wget http://repos.pni-hdri.de/trixie-pni-hdri.sources

and for Ubuntu (Resolute)

.. code-block:: bash

   $ wget http://repos.pni-hdri.de/resolute-pni-hdri.sources

The packages are also available for Debian Trixie, Bookworm, Bullseye and Ubuntu Resolute, Noble, Jammy.
For older releases the ATP source file has the .list extension.

Once you have downloaded the file use

.. code-block:: bash

   $ apt-get update


to update your package list and

.. code-block:: bash

   $ apt-get install libpninexus3.5.0 libpninexus3.5.0-dev libpninexus3.5.0-doc

to install the library. Dependencies will be resolved automatically so you can
start with working right after the installation has finished.


Install from sources
====================

If your OS platform or a particular Linux distribution is currently not
supported you have to build `libpninexus` from its sources. As this process
usually requires some expert knowledge keep be prepared to get your hands dirty.

Requirements
------------

For a successful build some requirements must be satisfied

* `h5cpp` >= 0.5.0
* `gcc` >= 4.7 -- since version 1.0.0 `libpninexus` requires a mostly C++11
   compliant compiler. For the gcc familiy this is 4.7 and upwards
* `BOOST` >= 1.60
* `doxygen` \cite{web:doxygen} -- used to build the API documentation
* `cmake` \cite{web:cmake} $>=$ 3.10 -- the build software used by the `libpninexus`
* `pkg-config` \cite{web:pkgconfig} -- program to manage libraries

Building the code
-----------------

The sources can be obtained directly from the Git repository.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/pni-libraries/libpninexus.git
   $ cd libpninexus
   $ cd ..

which will result in a new directory named :file:`libpninexus`. As we use
:command:`cmake` for
building the library, out of place builds are recommended. For this purpose
create a new directory where the code will be built and change to this directory

.. code-block:: bash

   $ mkdir libpninexus-build
   $ cd libpninexus-build

Now call :command:`cmake` with a path to the original source directory

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPNINEXUS_CONAN=DISABLE ../libpninexus

or

.. code-block:: bash

   $ export H5CPP=/opt/pni/lib/cmake/h5cpp-0.8.0
   $ cmake -Dh5cpp_DIR=$H5CPP -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/pni -DPNINEXUS_CONAN=DISABLE ../libpninexus

if `h5cpp` is installed in the non-standard directory.

A subsequent :command:`make` finally build the library

.. code-block:: bash

   $ make

This may take a while. Actually building the library is quite fast as
`libpninexus` is mostly a template, and thus header-only, library.
However, building the test suite is rather time consuming.

Testing the build
-----------------

Once the build has finished you should definitely run the tests.
`libpninexus` uses the :command:`ctest` facility of :command:`cmake`. To build
and run the tests just type

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make check


Installation
------------

If the build has passed the test suite `libpninexus` can be installed from within
the build directory with

.. code-block:: bash

   $ make install

By default the installation prefix is :file:`/usr/local`. If another prefix should
be used the :envvar:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable must be set when running
:command:`cmake` with

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/pni -DPNINEXUS_CONAN=DISABLE ../libpninexus

which causes the installation prefix to be :file:`/opt/pni`.
